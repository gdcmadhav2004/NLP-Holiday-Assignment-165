## Project Overview

### Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

The sentiment analysis project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to determine their sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). The project involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a dataset of customer reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing machine learning models to classify the sentiment of the reviews.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Getting Started

To explore the notebooks and run the code:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gdcmadhav2004/NLP-Holiday-Assignment-165.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd NLP-Holiday-Assignment-165
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
